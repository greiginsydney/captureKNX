# knxLogger documentation

If you're new to the knxLogger, there's plenty of documentation to whet your whistle.

## Shopping list

The [shopping list](/docs/shopping-list.md) itemises everything you'll need, and gives some config options.

## Installation & commissioning steps

1. [prepare the topology export](/docs/step1-prepare-the-topology-export.md) - start here by exporting the topology (project file) in ETS.

2. [Setup the Pi](/docs/step2-setup-the-Pi.md) walks you through the process to install all the software on the Pi. (The setup script does all the hard work!)


## Debugging / troubleshooting

- [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting.md).
- The [Frequently Asked Questions](/docs/FAQ.md) page is mostly answers to the "how do I...?" questions users might ask.

## Upgrading

The upgrade process is the same as a fresh installation. The setup script detects the presence of an existing version and reacts accordingly.

Read more on the [Upgrade](/docs/upgrade.md) page. (TODO)

## Advanced Applications

If you're wondering if the knxLogger has any more tricks up its sleeve, have a look at the [Advanced Applications](/docs/advanced-applications.md) page.
