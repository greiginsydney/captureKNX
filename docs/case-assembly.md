# Case Assembly

It's not mandatory that you build captureKNX into the 3D-printed cases presented here, although the absence of mounting holes on the Weinzierl HAT will present you with some risks of damage if you don't - specifically when plugging in and removing the KNX connector. Caveat emptor and all that.

For both HATs we've provided the drawings for a 2-part assembly. The artwork also includes a small [Fing-Longer](https://futurama.fandom.com/wiki/Fing-Longer) extension so you can still access the Pi's power button.

## TIJL / Tindie

Here's a cutaway view showing the Fing-Longer (which you need to install before adding the Pi), the two sets of GPIO extensions, spacers and HAT:

Not shown is the piece of clear filament that acts as a light pipe for the Pi's power LED, which also needs to go in before the Pi.

Here's the completed assembly minus the lid. The 30x30x7mm fan is a friction fit into the lid. The fan's not blessed with a long cable, which plugs into the cream connector visible behind the USB2.0 connectors on the Pi.

## Weinzierl

Here's a cutaway view showing the Fing-Longer (which you need to install before adding the Pi), the GPIO extensions, mounting screws and HAT:

Given the lack of mounting holes on this HAT, it's sandwiched in place by two small ledges on the far side of the box, and a matching one in the lid.
